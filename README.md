# STM32F3-Project

This is a firmware project developed for an STMicroelectronics STM32-F334 Nucleo microcontroller in the context of the class of "Reti per l'Automazione Industriale" (Industrial Automation Networks) from the Master Degree Course in Computer Engineering at University of Catania.

The firmware allows the STM32-F334 Nucleo to communicate wireless with another microcontroller board, an STM32F0 Discovery provided by the teacher, via an nRF24L01+ Ultra Low Power wireless transceiver, connected to the microcontroller's SPI, using a simple GET and SET protocol.
